# Talos-CNC
Complete CNC Control (Thats the goal)

Due to a lack of interest in this project I have slowed down development significantly. I would still love to work on this project in collaboration with others. I think its some great firmware, and it does do basic functions on a machine. IF anyone would like to work on it with me feel free to open an issue and let me know. I'll get an email and respond.
