# Talos-CNC
Complete CNC Control (Thats the goal)
I have created a facebook group to work on collaboration efforts. You can can find it here:

After 6 years I am nearing the first rounf of completion. This will no longer funciton on the Atmel 328, 2560, SAM boards. This project has moved to the STM32H745 or STM32H750 processors. These boards can be found on ebay for $20-$30.

This is a HUGE project, capable of running on a Windows platform, or a mCU. I am no longer going to keep all the projects up to date for the various platforms it runs on. The only 2 platforms I will be focusing on for the near future, and possibly forever are WIN32 and STM32.

There seems to be confusion as to what this project is. It is NOT a copy of GRBL, Smoothie, TinyG, etc. I have used elements and features of some of those projects, but this is not a port of one of those projects to a different processor. What is, is a completley new motion processor system.

Please see the wiki page for details on features/functions
