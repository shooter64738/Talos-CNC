/*
This used to be a large class with many options. I have instead made the underlying data structure
a very simple struct with only minimal data needed. To view that struct information (which is compact)
in a meaningful way that is easy to work with, you simply pass that struct to this classes 'load'
function and the data can be accessed through this class using simple access methods that are easy
for humans to understand. The struct data will remain small however and that is all that will be
needed to store in the buffer array. This allows almost twice as much storage space.
